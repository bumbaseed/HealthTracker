# HealthTracker

The code will seem heavily commented, this is for my own learning benefit as i like to go back to projects to review the code, makes life much easier.

This project uses a pre-built data set featuring health statistics from FitBit data. The data will be used to conduct statistical testing and highlight the results in digestible format, allowing the user to review their stats and make any necessary changes. Once the code is working, the plan is to swap from a pre-defined data set to the FitBit API.
